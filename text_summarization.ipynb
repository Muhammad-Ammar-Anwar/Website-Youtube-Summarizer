It depletes their already meagre resources, accentuates \\nthe levels of poverty especially when launder ed money puts pressure on the \\ncurrency and leads to its devaluation. At the current rate, when the FACTI Panel \\nestimates that a tri llion dollar every  year is taken out of the developing world, \\nthere will be mass exodus of economic migrants towards the richer nations.  \\n \\nWhat the East India Company did to India, the crooked ruling elites are doing to \\ndeveloping world  - plundering the we alth and transferring to western capitals \\nand offshore tax havens.  \\n \\nAnd Mr. President, retrieving the stolen assets from the developed  countries is \\nimpossible for poor nations.

I call on this General Assembly to demand that Syed \\nGeelani’s mortal remains be allo wed to be buried in the “cemetery of martyrs” \\nwith the appropriate Islamic rites. \\n \\nMr. President, \\n \\nPakistan desires peace with India, as with all its neighbours. But sustainable \\npeace in South Asia is contingent upon resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir \\ndispute, in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council \\nresolutions, and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.  \\n \\nLast February, we reaffirmed the 2003 ceasefire understanding along the Line \\nof Control. The hope was that it would lead to a rethink of the strategy i n New \\nDelhi. Sadly, the BJP government has intensified repression in Kashmir and \\ncontinues to vitiate the environment by these barbaric acts.  \\n \\nThe onus remains on India to create a conducive environment for meaningful \\nand result-oriented engagement with Pakistan. And for that, it must do: \\n \\nOne, reverse its un ilateral and illeg al measures instituted since 5 th \\nAugust 2019; \\nTwo, stop its oppression and human rights violations against the \\npeople of Kashmir; and \\nThree, halt and reverse the demographic changes in the occupi ed \\nterritory. \\n \\nIt is also essential to prev ent another confli ct between Pakistan and India. \\nIndia’s military build -up, development of advanced nuclear weapons, and \\nacquisition of destabilising conventional capabilities, can erode mutual \\ndeterrence between the two countries. \\n \\nAnd now Mr. President, I want to talk abo ut Afghanistan. For t he current \\nsituation in Afghanistan, for some reason, Pakistan has been blamed for the turn \\nof events, by politicians in the United States and some politicians in Europe.'),\n",

There \\nwere 3.5 million internal ly displaced Pakistanis. And why did this happe n? In \\nthe 1980s, Pakistan was a front -line state in fighting against the occupation of \\nAfghanistan. Pakistan and the United States trained Mujahideen groups to fight \\nfor the liberation of Afghanistan. Amongst those Mujahideen groups was Al-\\nQaeda, various groups from all over the world. There were Mujahideen, Afghan \\nMujahideen. These were considered heroes.  \\n \\nPresident Ronald Regan invited them to the White House in 1983. And \\naccording to a news item , he compared them to the  founding father s of the \\nUnited States. They were heroes.  \\n \\nCome 1989, the Soviets leave, and so d o the Americans - abandoning \\nAfghanistan. Pakistan was left with 5 million Afghan refugees. We were left \\nwith sectarian militant groups which were never existed befo re. But the worse \\ncut of it was, that a year later Pakistan was sanctioned by the US. We felt used.  \\n \\nFast forward 9/11, Pakistan is needed again by the US, because now the US-led \\ncoalition was invading Afghanistan, and it could not happen  without Pakistan \\nproviding all the logistical support.  \\n \\nWhat happened after that?  \\n \\nThe same Mujahideen that we had trained, that fighting foreign occupation was \\na sacred duty, a holy war or jehad, turned against us.  \\n \\nWe were called collaborators.  \\n \\nThey declared jehad on us. Then all along the tribal belt bordering Afghanistan - \\nPakistan’s semi-autonomous tribal belt - where no Pakistan army had been there \\nsince our independence, people had strong sympathies with the Afghan Taliban, \\nnot because of their religious ideology but be cause of Pashtun nationalism, \\nwhich is very strong. Then there are three million Afghan refugees still in'),\n",

And they too attacked the Government of Pakistan. \\nWhen our Army went into the tribal areas first time in our history - whenever an \\narmy goes into the civilian areas , there is collateral damage  - so, there was \\ncollateral damage, which multiplied the militants to seek revenge.

We must strengthen and stabilize the \\ncurrent government, for the sake of the people of Afghanistan.  \\n \\nWhat have the Taliban promised?  \\nThey will respect human rights.  \\nThey will have an inclusive government.  \\nThey will not allow their soil to be used by terrorist. \\nAnd they have given amnesty. \\n \\nIf the world community incentivises them, and encourages them to walk this \\ntalk, it will be a  win-win situatio n for everyone.

Nor do the \\ncatastrophes imposed by uncertain weather patterns.  \\n \\nThe common threats faced by us today not  only expose the fragility of the \\ninternational system; they also underscore the oneness of humanity.  \\n \\nBy the grace of Almighty Allah, Pakistan has been successful so far in \\ncontaining the Covid pa ndemic.

Over 15 million \\nfamilies survived through our social protection programme of Ehsaas.  \\n \\nMr. President,'),\n",

The influx of Afghan refugees sympathetic to the Taliban, coupled with US drone strikes, fueled militancy within Pakistan, leading to attacks and instability. Despite Pakistan's sacrifices, the speaker feels they are blamed for the current situation in Afghanistan and receive no appreciation for their efforts. \n",

      "The speaker emphasizes the urgent need for international action to prevent a humanitarian crisis and potential resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan. They call for supporting and stabilizing the current Taliban government by incentivizing them to uphold their promises of respecting human rights, forming an inclusive government, preventing their territory from being used by terrorists, and granting amnesty. \n",

Khan detailed human rights violations in Kashmir, including alleged abductions, extrajudicial killings, and the destruction of villages. He accused India of attempting to change the demographic structure of the region and violating UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir.  Khan's condemnation was particularly poignant in light of the denial of a proper Islamic burial to the Kashmiri leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani by the Indian government, which he called a \"barbaric act\" against basic human decency.\n",
